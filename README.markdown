# Flexible Email Parser

The goal of this tool is to provide an easy way to extract all the emails out of an arbitrary chunk of text and format them for use in an email client.

## How to use

Simply paste some text into the text area on the index page and a formatted list of all the email addresses found in that text will appear in another text area.  Copy that list and paste it into the to or cc fields of your email client and send away!
